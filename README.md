# Credit Card Fraud Detection 🕵️‍♀️💳

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques in Python. It involves data analysis, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `credit card.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses a dataset of credit card transactions (usually based on the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)) containing anonymized features and a binary class label:
- `Class = 1`: Fraudulent
- `Class = 0`: Legitimate

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost / LightGBM (optional)
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC.

## 🛠️ Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling class imbalance
- Feature scaling
- Model training and tuning
- Performance evaluation

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn (for SMOTE or similar)
